This project aims to solve the problem of environment determination of robots as the possible maps of environment is already known. In the other words, the algorithm helps the robot to choose the right environment which he is currently standing on from a group of candidate maps.

The total project is running on the ROS platform, version indigo. It uses the turtlebot-simulator as the robot agent.

Currently it is not finished yet, so we welcome every visit and suggestion.
